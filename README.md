# AI-Ideator


Use this agent as your AI partner in crime to turn rough ideas and problems into clear, reusable prompts, workflows, and solutions. This makes our AI usage faster, more reliable, and easier to share so everyone benefits from what we learn.
<br><br>
Newly realeased v2.41 improvements: This update delivers a fully refactored, language‑agnostic Agent Instruction YAML designed for reliable use in Microsoft Agent Builder. The configuration is streamlined, fully English, and optimized for stability, minimal hallucinations, and complete Excel output consistency. Added more precise decision path and user support for Agent Builder / Copilot Studio scenario.
<br><br>
To set up just copy&paste sourcecode in Agent Builder or use zip file from repository to import in Copilot Studio

- AI Ideator is based on an ideation canvas framework pulled together by me
- it is intended to guide everyone in a strutured way from idea to solution
- it works for process digitalization, automation as well as agent scenarios
- the beauty: the agent takes to through the framework, ending up in providing you the framweork as Excel for further usage
- and: if worked through the excel in an ideation session, you can continue to work with it with the agent, let it review, add and complete
- the base framework Excel also is placed in the repository for your use

Goal / Value Proposition
- Enable colleagues to turn ideas and problems into clear, high‑quality AI use cases, prompts, and workflows.
- Reduce trial‑and‑error and save time when working with Copilot, automations, and complex tasks.
- Increase the quality, consistency, and reusability of AI solutions across teams.
- Build confidence and adoption of AI in everyday work, not just in isolated experiments.

Solution
- An AI “sparring partner” that helps structure ideas, clarify goals, and formulate effective prompts/workflows.
- Guided, step‑by‑step support from problem statement to solution draft (including edge cases and errors).
- Reusable patterns and wording that can be shared with others instead of starting from scratch each time.
- A fast feedback loop: we iterate together until the result is precise, robust, and ready to use or automate.

Problem Statement
- People often know what they want from AI, but struggle to describe it in a way the system understands.
- Trial‑and‑error prompt writing costs time and leads to inconsistent, hard‑to‑repeat results.
- Knowledge about “what works well with AI” sits in individual heads instead of being shared and standardized.
- Without structure and support, AI remains a nice demo instead of a scaled, reliable part of daily work.

## Remarks
- Find a setup HowTo Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUJ2QMdkSmU
- as the instructions are simple - feel free to adapt as needed to meet your orgs needs (best: use simple logical actions for this to make sure it works properly)
- as you are going to set up a solely web grounded, declarative only agent it should work free of charge even without M365 Copilot license (no guarantees, see complementary links below, MUST be created with Agent Builder or as declarative Agent in Copilot Studio in that case)
- the agent solely uses already available M365 Copilot Chat functionality - nothing added - nothing worked through
